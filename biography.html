      One night in 1991, I was born in a small market town in the north of... ok, maybe my <em>whole</em> life story isn't a good idea. Why don't I tell you about the past 10 years or so?<br><br>

      I went to university to study psychology and did that for almost 10 years. I focused on researching topics in perception, particularly how the brain perceives emotions from faces and how the brain combines multisensory signals to produce behavioural benefits.
      After I got my PhD, I used my skills in with statistics and programming to move into data analysis. That's where I am today! Aside from work, I make videos online that combine my love of editing short films, making music, and writing jokes.<br><br>

      I'm always trying to learn new things and get better at what I already know. I love solving problems and helping other people do the same, and am happiest when left to create stuff all on my own.
      I'm always happy to chat about psychology, data analysis, writing comedy, making videos, synthesisers, or your favourite David Lynch film; if you have a question, get in touch!
